It’s built on <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a>, which is a whole progressively-enhanced, React powered static site generator song and dance.</p>\n<p>I’d been using my <a href=\"https://vcolavin.wordpress.com/\">previous Wordpress dot com-based blog</a> since <a href=\"https://vcolavin.wordpress.com/2012/08/18/a-blueprint/\">August 2012</a>, which is seven years ago at the time of this writing. Seven years is a long time for a website. I started it in college, and I kept it through a significant chunk of my professional career. I’ll keep it up for now</p>\n<p>I didn’t come to blogging from a tech background. I started my earliest blog on Blogspot around 2005, when I was 13. I enjoyed writing and sharing my thoughts with my mom and her grad student friends. It was very nice of them to humor me. I wasn’t very cool, but I deeply craved their respect.</p>\n<p>Here’s a screenshot from my earliest extant blog, which is still hosted on Blogspot:</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ab53f40b119bd668f0d37b730bd71728/82339/first_blog_screenshot.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 456px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 32.01754385964912%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAYAAADDl76dAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAA9UlEQVQY06WR627DIAyF8/5P2NyAcEkrrdmSAblKObXdrtv/IR0Zg/3ZhuKYE1JvsKcJ/1nneYotlhTx4S2+PwfkecZMyjkjpfRUTOJP0yQ+x6QYEel8WRayEftxvKHFMAy4lDWc92jbVtR1Vqwi1VUDrTXKskRVVbDWQisFbQyU0miahppYfoGZqjZ1DU9A5wMCyVAwQ7Q2BHAIIVCRTtQS4EJwRVBHdwwNoafu83PkcRwl2TkHQwkM7vset+vtBbKSZExHxTyUFNIywZVieGx+pnVdf4BfqKlDHoUBLN4zmDu63wcJ3rbtbfd9F9Dxeru/H/MAkdHFjnSpkmEAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"This is a screenshot from my earliest extant blog.

I am sad about that.</p>\n<h2>Anyways,</h2>\n<p>This is the third major blogging platform era for me. I am switching over because I want to have finer control over the look and feel. The previous blog was very dated and didn’t suit my needs very well. Although I could have spent time choosing a more appropriate theme, I want to use tools which I’ve already invested in (e.g. React, JavaScript), rather than learning a big new toolset as Wordpress would require.</p>\n<p>Also, I wanted it to be on my own domain, hosted for free by Github Pages like the rest of my site. This is just a super easy way of making that happen.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Switching to Gatsby","date":"March 16, 2019","description":"I'm doing a new blog with Gatsby."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019/03/16/switching-to-gatsby/","previous":null,"next":null}}
