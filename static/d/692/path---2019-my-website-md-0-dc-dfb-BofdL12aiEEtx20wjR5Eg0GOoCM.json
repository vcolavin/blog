You can see the current version at <a href=\"https://vcolavin.com\">vcolavin.com</a>.</p>\n<p>I don’t think it really needs justification. For the kind of jobs I was applying for, I didn’t need to communicate serious professionalism. I needed an online place which communicates a few important pieces of information, preferrably with a memorable and sincere brand.</p>\n<h2>First, the information.</h2>\n<p>The core purpose of my site is to allow people to learn about me if they want to, particularly if they’re a recruiter or hiring manager. I wanted someone to be able to get the key information in very few clicks, but also be able to dig deeper if they were interested.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Name and pronouns</li>\n<li>Job title</li>\n<li>Resume</li>\n<li>Contact information (which I put on the resume rather than directly on the site to decrease spam)</li>\n<li>Portfolio</li>\n<li>Blog</li>\n</ol>\n<p>None of this was complicated, but it was important to me to keep it central.</p>\n<h2>Second, Branding.</h2>\n<p>I am, at a spiritual level, yucked out by branding. I understand that organizations have a need for it, and I respect the work of the people who specialize in branding, but it I can’t escape how icky it feels. One is essentially constructing a personality for an inherently apersonal object. I can’t get over the feeling of being mislead.</p>\n<p>(As an aside, I think I’m not the only one who feels this way. This explains the rise of the <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pangw8/brand-twitter-is-absurd-and-it-will-only-get-worse\">weirdly personal branded twitter</a>. By peeling back the curtain and allowing a company’s social media manager to speak sincerely in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steak_umm/status/1045038141978169344\">their own voice</a>, we are no longer being obliged to play along with the uncomfortable and absurd fiction that a brand itself is writing tweets. I prefer this paradigm.)</p>\n<p>But these hangups don’t apply so much when we’re talking about personal branding, as long as that brand is sincere. Branding might be a kind</p>\n<p>So I went through my Instagram archives and found this image:</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b05624e7cb9945904683601a23fbf5f4/30e4e/face.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 288px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"An image of my face.\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/b05624e7cb9945904683601a23fbf5f4/30e4e/face.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b05624e7cb9945904683601a23fbf5f4/43209/face.jpg 148w,\n/static/b05624e7cb9945904683601a23fbf5f4/30e4e/face.jpg 288w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>I really like this picture.
