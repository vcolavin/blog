It’s built on <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a>, which is a whole progressively-enhanced, React powered static site generator song and dance. It’ll be easy for me to customize it, if I ever get around to doing that.</p>\n<p>I’m switching to Gatsby for blogging because I want to have finer control over its look and feel. The theme I had been using on my Wordpress blog doesn’t look very good and didn’t adapt well to writing about code. I could spend time choosing or building a more appropriate theme, but I want to use tools which I’ve already invested in (e.g. React, JavaScript), rather than the big new toolset Wordpress would require.</p>\n<p>I also wanted my blog to be on my own domain, hosted for free by Github Pages like the rest of my site. A static site generator like Gatsby or Jekyll makes that super easy.</p>\n<p>I’d been using my <a href=\"https://vcolavin.wordpress.com/\">old Wordpress blog</a> since <a href=\"https://vcolavin.wordpress.com/2012/08/18/a-blueprint/\">August 2012</a>, or seven years ago at the time of this writing. Seven years is a long time for a website. I started it in college, and I kept it through a significant chunk of my professional career. I’m not going to delete it, but I’ll only add new posts here.</p>\n<p>I didn’t come to blogging from a tech background. I started my earliest blog on Blogspot around 2005, when I was 13. I liked to share my writing with my mom and her grad student friends. It was big of them to humor me. I wasn’t very cool, but I deeply craved their respect.</p>\n<p>Here’s a screenshot from my earliest extant blog, which is still hosted on Blogspot:</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/blog/static/ab53f40b119bd668f0d37b730bd71728/3abf2/first_blog_screenshot.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 456px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 32.01754385964912%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAYAAADDl76dAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAA9UlEQVQY06WR627DIAyF8/5P2NyAcEkrrdmSAblKObXdrtv/IR0Zg/3ZhuKYE1JvsKcJ/1nneYotlhTx4S2+PwfkecZMyjkjpfRUTOJP0yQ+x6QYEel8WRayEftxvKHFMAy4lDWc92jbVtR1Vqwi1VUDrTXKskRVVbDWQisFbQyU0miahppYfoGZqjZ1DU9A5wMCyVAwQ7Q2BHAIIVCRTtQS4EJwRVBHdwwNoafu83PkcRwl2TkHQwkM7vset+vtBbKSZExHxTyUFNIywZVieGx+pnVdf4BfqKlDHoUBLN4zmDu63wcJ3rbtbfd9F9Dxeru/H/MAkdHFjnSpkmEAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"This is a screenshot from my earliest extant blog.
