It’s built on <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a>, which is a whole progressively-enhanced, React powered static site generator song and dance. It’ll be easy for me to customize it, if I ever get around to doing that.</p>\n<p>I’m switching to Gatsby for blogging because I want to have finer control over its look and feel. The theme I had been using on my Wordpress blog doesn’t look very good and didn’t adapt well to writing about code. I could spend time choosing or building a more appropriate theme, but I want to use tools which I’ve already invested in (e.g. React, JavaScript), rather than the big new toolset Wordpress would require.</p>\n<p>I also wanted my blog to be on my own domain, hosted for free by Github Pages like the rest of my site. A static site generator like Gatsby or Jekyll makes that super easy.</p>\n<p>I’d been using my <a href=\"https://vcolavin.wordpress.com/\">old Wordpress blog</a> since <a href=\"https://vcolavin.wordpress.com/2012/08/18/a-blueprint/\">August 2012</a>, or seven years ago at the time of this writing. Seven years is a long time for a website. I started it in college, and I kept it through a significant chunk of my professional career. I’m not going to delete it, but I’ll only add new posts here.</p>\n<p>I didn’t come to blogging from a tech background. I started my earliest blog on Blogspot around 2005, when I was 13. I liked to share my writing with my mom and her grad student friends. It was big of them to humor me. I wasn’t very cool, but I deeply craved their respect.</p>\n<p>Here’s a screenshot from my earliest extant blog, which is still hosted on Blogspot:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 456px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/blog/static/ab53f40b119bd668f0d37b730bd71728/7f664/first_blog_screenshot.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 32.278481012658226%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAYAAADDl76dAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAA8ElEQVQY06VR7Y6EIAz0/V9QNwIiH2riBgHjuavobKhmL7m/R9K0HabTFoq0LpgNx9s/8Z9znif5Yl0WDFbDPUd47xFCIJumiXLnHLwPGMeR4hgjJufoPs4zYa/X+ytaxBBQVg9ordE0DRhjaNsWnHFwzlHXjPC6rlFVD7oTQqBpJIS48BDir+C6/kBwDq0UtDawtqMiKSWkbKGUgjGWsBznhmVZgTFO/MwxxsCHcK08x0gd84S5yNyiwzDAWksiWVwpja678iyUJ8ycbdu+dgnOkVbLpL7r0fcDjNG3mKY3SvuOlBL22x/HQXH2fz/mA2+SxViRHwj4AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"This is a screenshot from my earliest extant blog.

It’s pretty bad. There used to be a post containing the first chapter of my fantasy adventure book, but it looks like I deleted it at some point. I’m bummed about that. I was deeply into R. A.
