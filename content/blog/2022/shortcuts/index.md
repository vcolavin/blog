title: Shortcuts I use a lot

For most developers, the practice of software development is, at a fundamental level, typing. There are alternatives, such as voice-to-text software, which can be especially useful for disabled people, but I am not an expert in that.

So while programming _is_ typing, typing is not most the _point_ of programming. As such, many developers learn to interact efficiently with computers via keyboard shortcuts, bypassing the mouse as much as possible. This may seem like a marginal and pointless task at first (it did to me!), but building flow and fluency with the medium becomes more valuable over time.

If you are a new programmer, do not try to learn and incorporate all of these at once! It took years for me to add these to my repertoire, and I am still learning.

I will start with a list of the most useful that you can get started with right away, and then delve into an exhaustive list. Note that these are the shortcuts that work out of the box on a fresh install. I also use some custom shortcuts for specific programming tasks that I will not list here.

Note: Sometimes, adding shift to a shortcut chord will do the shortcut in the opposite direction. For example, `cmd + tab` selects the next application, and `cmd + shift + tab` selects the previous application. I won't list this shift modifier exhaustively.

## Most useful shortcuts (start here!)

| Shortcut    | Description                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cmd + tab` | Switch apps. Hold down `cmd` and tap `tab` to keep moving. |
| `tab`       | Move focus to next focusable element                       |

## Global shortcuts for MacOS

| Shortcut      | Description                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cmd + tab`   | Switch apps. Hold down `cmd` and tap `tab` to keep moving. |
| `cmd + tilde` | Switch windows in current app                              |
| `cmd + space` | Open Spotlight search                                      |
| `cmd + w`     | Close current window or tab                                |
| `cmd + q`     | Quit current application                                   |
| `cmd + +/-`   | Zoom in or out                                             |
| `cmd + ,`     | Open current app preferences/settings                      |

## Terminal

| Shortcut          | Description         |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| `ctrl + c`        | End current program |
| `ctrl + d`        | End current program |
| `cmd + shift + [` | Move one tab left   |
| `cmd + shift + ]` | Move one tab right  |

## Text editing stuff

These work for most text editing contexts, like VSCode, SublimeText, Google Docs, or any old text box on a web page. They will not work in the terminal, vim, or emacs.

| Shortcut                            | Description                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `shift + direction key`             | select text in that direction     |
| `option + left/right arrow`         | move one word to the left/right   |
| `shift + option + left/right arrow` | select one word to the left/right |
| `shift + option + left/right arrow` | select one word to the left/right |
| `cmd + c`                           | copy selection to clipboard       |
| `cmd + v`                           | paste clipboard contents          |
| `cmd + z`                           | undo                              |
| `cmd + s`                           | save                              |
| `cmd + f`                           | find on page                      |

The following are specific to VSCode and similar code editors.

| Shortcut                       | Description                               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `cmd + shift + z` or `cmd + y` | redo                                      |
| `cmd + d`                      | select next instance of current selection |
| `cmd + click`                  | place new cursor                          |
| `cmd + shift + f`              | open global find                          |
| `cmd + shift + e`              | open and close file tree sidebar          |

## Browser

I could write a whole series of articles on the importance of tab navigation, including its role in accessibility and discoverability. Tab navigation is one of the most useful ways to interact with the web, but two of the three main browsers have it disabled by default. Make sure you enable it!

1. **For Safari**
   Safari Preferences > Advanced > Press Tab to highlight each item on a webpage

2. **Firefox:**
   System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls (at the bottom of the window)

3. **Chrome**
   Tab navigation is enabled by default in Chrome.

| Shortcut                | Description                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `tab`                   | focus next focusable element (see note about Firefox) |
| `cmd + shift + i`       | open dev tools                                        |
| `escape` (in dev tools) | toggle JS console                                     |
