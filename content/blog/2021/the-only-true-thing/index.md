I don't want to lie or mislead. I want the things I say to be true. I don't think this is necessarily virtuous, it's just a preoccupation of mine.

I have a memory of being 4 or 5 years old. It was mother's day, and I refused to tell my mom she was the best mom in the world. I had been told it was the expected thing to say. But it wouldn't have been honest, I explained. I was confident she was a very good mom, but I didn't want to say that she was the best out of all of them. I hadn't met all the moms in the world. It wouldn't have been honest for me to tell her she was the best.

In hindsight, it was precocious and cute. I only understanding the surface level of the words, a very shallow version of truth.

Very often if you try to say something which is absolutely true, you'll find edge cases where it's false. The exalted Golden Rule, for example, has a pretty big loophole. Treating others as you'd like to be treated opens they way for masochists to treat other people terribl. Like a Bukowski situation.

So you try and pare down overbroad advice until it is totally and always true, and what is left is so vague as to no longer be useful. Certainly a more totally true version of the Golden Rule is "be good to people", but that's not very actionable, and pretty open to interpretation. I think most bad people sincerely believe they're being good. It's important to the worldview of the fascist that he is actually somehow good despite the harm he does.

It is hard to find truths both useful and univeral. The world is just more complicated than that. You shouldn't steal unless you need to. Do no harm, unless someone really needs harm done to them.

So for a few years now, I've conscientiously tried to collect useful and universal truths. Until recently, I had three:

1. If you're ever doing something in your house and you think to yourself "should I be doing this over the sink?", you should certainly do it over the sink.
2. If someone tries to break up with you, let them.
3. When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time
